The [BEBEN X8
headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PN2FK2W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=c7e6ea9cd21015aa5bb8bae9d67481db&language=en_US)
are a set of true wireless headphones, as in there isn't a cord between the
buds.

[Apple
Airpods](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=airpods&qid=1597609643&s=electronics&sr=1-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=f74c368f5b3a2c83060da85acc1b2394&language=en_US)
have made true wireless headphones ubiquitous.

I was interested in buying a pair of true wireless headphones and based on what
I've seen on Amazon, it's a commoditized technology. There are plenty of options
from the other big electronics companies. Samsung has their [Galaxy
Buds](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Earbuds-Cancelling-Warranty/dp/B089B658NP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=galaxy+buds&qid=1597609784&s=electronics&sr=1-6&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=db5cafcb0e4ebeeae94ba2966657ebbd&language=en_US),
Sony has their [WF-1000XM3
headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=sony+wf-1000xm3&qid=1597611240&s=electronics&sr=1-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=50eb905f27c0da50abc99f7c348f0e91&language=en_US)
and Google has their [Pixel
Buds](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_buds). But as I was searching on
Amazon, I realized that there are plenty of smaller brands that produce these
headphones at a much power price.

I had particular things that I was looking for. I mainly planned to use my
headphones while exercising.

I wanted headphones with explicit waterproofing because I wanted to be able to
run in the rain with them.

I also wanted physical buttons, mainly for quick volume adjustments without
having to mess with a touch sensitive interface or having to speak to a digital
assistant, which would be annoying to do while running.

I found that most of the knockoff ones have touch controls.

I bought mine for $46, and I've seen it go as low as $30.

## Waterproofing

I've gone running a few times in the rain with these on, and they kept working
just fine, even after getting considerably wet. Technically, they are [IP
rated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code) for IP68, which means that they do
not allow any dust in and are waterproof even after being submerged for more
than 1 meter. I haven't tested actually submerging them in water.

## Charging

The case can be charged via either micro-USB or with wireless charging.
