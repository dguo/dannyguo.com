title: I Published My AWS Secret Key to GitHub
---

One of my earliest programming projects was a basic news headlines aggregator
that would display the top three headlines for each news source. I called it
[The Daily Lore](https://dailylore.com/). The [original
site](https://www.dailylore.com/legacy/) was [hosted on AWS S3 as a static
website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).
At the time, I didn't know how to make a dynamic, server-generated website, so
my hacky solution for updating the headlines was to run a Python script that
would generate a JavaScript file with the headlines hardcoded inside. The
script then updated the JS file in the S3 bucket. To automate the updates, I
ran the script on a micro EC2 instance in a cron job. Crucially, that means the
script needed an AWS secret key.

Eventually, AWS terminated my instance for some reason, and I abandoned the
website for a while. I revived it a few years later with a [new
repo](https://github.com/dguo/dailylore). Last month, I was cleaning up my
Google Drive when I came across the old source code. I had stored the `.git`
folder as well, so I decided to push the
[repo](https://github.com/dguo/headlines) up to GitHub just for fun.

A few minutes later, I got an email:

> Amazon Web Services has opened case ******** on your behalf.
>
> The details of the case are as follows:
>
> Case ID: ********
>
> Subject: Your AWS account ******** is compromised
>
> Severity: Urgent
>
> Correspondence: Dear AWS Customer,
>
> Your AWS Account is compromised! Please review the following notice and take
> immediate action to secure your account.
>
> Your security is important to us. We have become aware that the AWS Access
> Key ******** along with the corresponding Secret Key is publicly available
> online at ********.
>
> This poses a security risk to your account and other users, could lead to
> excessive charges from unauthorized activity or abuse, and violates the AWS
> Customer Agreement.
>
> Please delete the exposed credentials from your AWS account by using the
> instructions below and take steps to prevent any new credentials from being

>
> To additionally protect your account from excessive charges, we have
> temporarily limited your ability to create some AWS resources. Please note
> that this does not make your account secure, it just partially limits the
> unauthorized usage for which you could be charged.
>
> Detailed instructions are included below for your convenience.

## Immediate actions

First, I let out a loud groan. I immediately knew the consequences of what I had
done. I've read [plenty of
stories](https://medium.com/@nagguru/exposing-your-aws-access-keys-on-github-can-be-extremely-costly-a-personal-experience-960be7aad039)
of nefarious people [scraping AWS
keys](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots/)
and spinning up tons of EC2 instances for purposes like cryptocurrency mining.

I deleted the GitHub repo, but like the email cautions, I knew that wasn't
enough. Once a secret is compromised once, it's compromised forever. I went
into the AWS console and invalidated the key. Luckily, this was on my personal
AWS account, and nothing else depended on that key. I got another AWS email a
few minutes later confirming that the compromised key had been deleted.

Then I went through each AWS region to make sure nothing suspicious was
present, like newly created servers or IAM users.

## Cleaning up and republishing

I still wanted to publish the repo, but I also wanted to scrub the secrets.
Even though they were no longer usable, I didn't want anyone to see them in the
future and get the impression that committing secrets is okay. It wouldn't be
enough to just remove them in a new commit because they would still be in the
Git history. This part was the silver lining because I knew about [the
BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) (I assume the name is a
reference to the [weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFG_%28weapon%29) in
[Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), but I'm not sure)
but had never gotten a chance to use it before. It made it very easy to remove
the secrets from the entire history.

I did a more thorough inspection and found other things in the repo that
shouldn't have ever been committed. There were `.pyc` files. There was a PDF
explaining how SVGs work. There was an Excel spreadsheet containing passwords
for services that I used for the site. At the time, I wasn't using a password
manager. Fortunately, I had changed all the passwords when I did start using a
password manager, so I didn't need to do so again. Lastly, there was even a SSH
private key for logging into the EC2 instance, and a script for doing so that
contained the host.

I used the BFG to remove all of these files. I double checked to make sure it
worked as expected, and then I re-pushed the repo to GitHub.

## Retrospective

I should have done a manual inspection of the files before pushing. I also
should have used a tool that is designed to find secrets in Git repos. There
are several of them:

* [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
* [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks)
* [Truffle Hog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog)

I should have distrusted my past self. While it's secondhand nature to me now
to use environment variables for secrets, to think about how they can be
leaked, and to be aware of which files should and shouldn't be committed to
Git, I forgot that at one point, I didn't know any of that. Lesson learned.
