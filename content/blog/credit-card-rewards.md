One of the more disappointing aspects of the American education system is the
almost complete lack of personal finance education. I graduated college with a
minor in finance, but I still had to learn about things like the types of
retirement accounts on my own initiative. Most people don't need to use
calculus or chemistry on a day to day basis, but every one has to deal with
money.

I've frequently given friends my spiel on why almost everyone should use credit
cards.

Most people should pay as much as possible with credit cards rather than
with debit cards, checks, or cash.

As a side note, I think it is worth knowing how these rewards are financed.
Ultimately, they are another instance of the unfortunate truth that it is
expensive to be poor.
