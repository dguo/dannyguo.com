One of my formative childhood lessons came when I was playing in the garage one
day. I went into my mom's minivan and put the seatbelt on (probably to pretend I
was flying a plane). I realized that I could still lean pretty far forward. Far
enough that my head could touch the dashboard. This seemed ridiculous! What's
the point of the seatbelt if it doesn't actually stop me from going too far? I
reveled in my discovery that seatbelts were useless.

A while later, I pulled on the seatbelt quickly (a lot happens in imaginary
aerial [dogfights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfight)), and the seatbelt
immediately stopped. An overwhelming feeling of stupidity hit me almost as
fast. Nine-year-old me was not in fact smarter than Toyota engineers.

For anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about, modern seatbelts have
dynamic behavior. If you pull on them slowly, they won't engage, allowing you to
retain your range of motion. If you pull on them quickly, which is what would
happen in a car crash, they'll stop quickly.

Now whenever I have the thought of "that's really stupid!", I try to check
myself and remember my experience with the seatbelt.

Sometimes things really are stupid, but my rule of thumb is to give greater
benefit of the doubt in proportion to how much I know about the subject.

And even for things I know somewhat well, that's still relative to my knowledge
in other things. There's so much I don't know.

## How It Works

I learned later that seatbelt have the dynamic behavior by using a centrifugal
clutch.
