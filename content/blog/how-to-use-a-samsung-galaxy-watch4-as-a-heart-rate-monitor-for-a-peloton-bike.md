title: How to Use a Samsung Galaxy Watch4 as a Heart Rate Monitor for a Peloton Bike
---

To use a [Samsung Galaxy
Watch4](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Smartwatch-Detection-Bluetooth/dp/B096BJLZZM?&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=edd3ac30f2add8f2a278045edc1c8a84&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)
as a heart rate monitor for a [Peloton bike](https://www.onepeloton.com/bikes),
use the free [Heart for
Bluetooth](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lukas.the.coder.heartforbluetooth)
app. Beyond seeing your heart rate in real time, syncing your heart rate also
allows you to use Peloton's [Strive
Score](https://blog.onepeloton.com/strive-score/) feature.

First [pair your
watch](https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/203418965-Pairing-Bluetooth-Headphones)
to your bike using Bluetooth.

Then open the Heart for Bluetooth app and your bike should connect and pick up
your heart rate. In my experience, it can be a little finicky. The most reliable
method that I've found is to turn on my bike first and then open the app.

You can try restarting Bluetooth advertising. You can also resync on the bike's
Bluetooth settings.

When you're done, you can manually end the app by pressing the flag button. This
lets you avoid draining your battery unnecessarily. Or you can rely on the
timeout feature, which will end the session automatically.

## Apple Watch

If you have an Apple Watch and a Peloton Bike+, syncing your heart rate is easy
because Bike+ [supports
GymKit](https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048226572-Pairing-Your-Apple-Watch-With-The-Peloton-Bike-).
If you have a regular Bike, you can try using the
[HeartCast](https://www.heartcast.app/) app.
