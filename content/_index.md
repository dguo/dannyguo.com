# Hello, World
Welcome to my corner of the Internet. Feel free to check out my
[writing](/blog) and [other activities](/projects). I'm currently working on [Sublime Fund](https://sublimefund.org), with the goal of getting more people involved in philanthropy.

If you have arrived here in error and/or are disappointed, try checking out a [trending subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/trendingsubreddits/), a [random Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random), or a [random YouTube video](http://www.ytroulette.com) instead.
