title: Seatbelts

When I was a kid, I remember playing in my mom's minivan. I was messing around
with the seatbelt when I realized that I could lean very far forward. Far enough
that my head could touch the dashboard. This seemed ridiculous to me! What's the
point of the seatbelt if it doesn't actually stop me from going too far?

A while later, I pulled on the seatbelt quickly, and it immediately stopped.
There was the lightbulb moment, followed by a strong feeling of stupidity. 10
year old me was not in fact smarter than Toyota engineers.

Now whenver I have the thought of "that's really stupid!", I try to check myself
and remember my experience with the seatbelt.

## How It Works

I learned later that seatbelt have the dynamic behavior by using a centrifugal
clutch.
