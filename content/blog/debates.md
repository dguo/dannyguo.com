At the beginning of my freshman year of high school, I attended an info session
for the debate team. I was very excited because I had an idea in my head of
what debates would be like: a bunch of people having a reasonable discussion
and arriving at conclusions based on that discussion. It never occurred to me
that in the context of high school debate teams, a debate is a competition. And
in any competition, the ultimate point is to win.

The feeling of disappointment came slowly. The info session mostly went over
the structure of a [Lincoln-Douglas
debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Douglas_debates). I
eventually realized that you win a debate by making the most convincing case
for your side of the position, and what side you would actually take in real
life is irrelevant! This seemed hopelessly disingenuous to me.

I get the same feeling every time I watch a political debate. No politician is
going to change his or her mind in the middle of a debate or acknowledge that
the opponent has made a good point.

We have fact checkers after the fact or sometimes even during the debates, but
that in itself is disheartening because it means the debates proceed with
statments that can't even be relied on.

We consider it a skill when debaters dodge the question by either ignoring it
or answering the question that they really wanted to be asked.

I'm not saying that debaters don't pick up valuable skills along the way. I've
watched videos of championship debates, and the level of discourse is far
higher than anything I see in everyday life.
