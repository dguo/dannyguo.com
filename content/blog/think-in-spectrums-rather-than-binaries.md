title: Think in Spectrums Rather Than Binaries
---

One of the biggest lessons I have learned is that it is better to think in
spectrums rather than binaries. Thinking in binaries means seeing the world in
black and white. A critical part of growing up is learning that the world is far
more complex than it seems at first. Thinking in spectrums means recognizing
this, even when it's not easy.

Keeping this principle in mind is more important when the topic more emotionally
charged. It's easy to label someone a racist for saying a single thing, but
racism is not a yes/no issue.

Thinking in binaries is most justified when there is an immediate time pressure.
You don't always have the luxury of time to deliberate. But these situations
don't happen enough to justify how often we oversimplify the world.

I try my best to always consider the other side of any argument, no matter what
it is. I don't have any belief that is sacred enough for me to make it a black
and white issue.
