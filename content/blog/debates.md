title: Debates as Sport
---

At the beginning of high school, I attended an info session for the debate team.
I was excited because I had a notion of what debates would be like: a group of
people having a discussion and arriving at conclusions based on evidence and
reasoning. It hadn't occurred to me that in the context of debate teams, a
debate is a competition. And in any competition, the ultimate point is to win.

A feeling of disappointment washed over me as the info session went over the
structure of a [Lincoln-Douglas
debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Douglas_debates). I
realized that you win a debate by making the most convincing case for your side
of the position, and what side you would actually take in real life is
irrelevant. This seemed hopelessly disingenuous to me.

I get the same feeling every time I watch a political debate. No politician is
going to change his or her mind in the middle of a debate or acknowledge that
the opponent has made a good point.

We have fact checkers after the fact or sometimes even during the debates, but
that in itself is disheartening because it means the debates proceed with
statements that can't even be relied on.

Plenty of arguments are superfluous anyway. Identifying the premises and chain
of reasoning will make it obvious in many situations what the debators are
actually disagreeing on. Doing it from the perspective of the conclusions is
largely a waste of time.

Once we get into the mindset that we're right, it's very hard to accept the
valid points of the opposite side's argument. To approach a debate from the
conclusions puts us in a defensive mindset. The conclusion is a belief, a part
of our identity. And that makes it [difficult to stay
open-minded](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html).

Some people consider it a skill when debaters dodge the question by either
ignoring it and answering the question that they really wanted to be asked.

I'm not saying that debaters don't pick up valuable skills along the way. I've
watched videos of championship debates, and the level of discourse is far
higher than what I typically experience in everyday life.

One of my favorite episodes in The West Wing is The Supremes.

In particular, the interaction between Chris Mulready and Charlie has always
stuck with me. Here's the transcript of [the
scene](https://youtu.be/q4m-3Eo3suE?t=40):

> So why a racial preference and not an economic one?
> Because affirmative action's about a legacy of racial oppression.
> It's about compromising admission standards.
> That's bull..excuse me. It's about leveling the playing field after 300 years

> Hang on, I gotta write this down.

Mulready is capable of articulating not just his own position but also the
opposing position. When is the last time you've seen this happen in a political
debate? Also notice that from what we can tell, he's doing so in relatively good
faith. He's basically saying "of these potential justifications for your
argument, here's the one that I find most compelling."

When arguing with someone, it's easy to get into the mindset of wanting to win.
But in real life, the real winner is the person who expands his or her mindset
and grasps not just the nuances of all sides of the argument.

The true test of a belief is being able to argue for the other side of a debate
even better than they can but then still being able to counter that argument.
Most people don't bother with this exercise. It requires humility and effort.
Our entrenched beliefs make it hard to be honest with ourselves.

Debate as sport can teach very useful skills, but it frames a debate as a
competition, which it doesn't have to be.

It'd be interesting to see a debate that takes place just as they do now, but
then the opponents have to switch sides and re-conduct the same debate.

Real debates on important things should take time.

Debates should happen through writing, not verbally.

Debators should be held accountable to the claims they make.

One of my pet peeves is when there is what seems like an obvious counterargument
to something, but the candidate never addresses it. See Paul Graham's views on
wealth inequality. What do progressives think of it?

Yes, interruptions are annoying during TV debates, but how else do you address
the details? The debates aren't long enough, and people wouldn't have enough
patience for candidates to address the finer points of an argument. But these
topics are complex and deserve that kind of scrutiny. I'd rather see a real deep
dive into a specific topic rather than getting overviews of several.
