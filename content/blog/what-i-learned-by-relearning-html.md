title: What I Learned by Relearning Html
---

I've been making websites for close to a decade now, both professionally and for
side projects. One day, I reflected on the fact that all of my web development
education has come in the middle of actually making websites. In most cases, I'd
have a specific problem, I'd Google how to solve it, and I'd learn something new
in the process.

I wondered what I was missing by never actually learning HTML in a comprehensive
way. Forget CSS and JavaScript. I'm just talking about raw HTML. It might seem
laughable to go back to such a basic aspect of web development, but I've
realized how easy it is to feel competent with a skill just because you can
know it enough to do some useful things.

So I resolved to relearn HTML and find out what I've been missing.

## History

For context, I made my first website in middle school for a class project. We
learned basic HTML, and I felt like a wizard when I discovered that I could
embed a MP3 song.

But I didn't touch web development again until college. I made a lightweight
news aggregator called [The Daily Lore](https://www.dailylore.com/). I preserved
the original version [here](https://www.dailylore.com/legacy).

Since then, I've worked on two websites professionally, one for a
[non-profit](https://sublimefund.org/), and a few tiny ones for side projects.

## Introduction to HTML5

So I wouldn't consider myself to be extremely experienced, but I surely had more
experience than the typical student for Coursera's [Introduction to
HTML5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html) course. I went in expecting to know
a lot of the content already, since the course was designed for complete
beginners.

I did in fact know a lot of the material already, but it was surprising how much
was still new to me. I knew enough to make a seemingly functional website, but
the course reminded me about the importance of using semantic elements and about
techniques to improve accessibility, things I had never paid much attention to.

Instead of semantic elements, I usually used a lot of generic divs to make what
I needed. The course taught me that in a lot of cases, there are specific
elements to use to represent specific content.

Accessibility was also something I had never considered. I knew that images
should have alt descriptions, and that was about it.

## Reading the Documentation

I wondered how much else I wasn't even aware of. So I decided to read the MDN
documentation for every HTML element. I have a friend who is probably the only
person I know who has read the entire NFL rulebook. Watching football with him
was fun because he was so much better than me at understanding weird cases and
how the referees would act. I figured there was a similar opportunity for me
with HTML.

I didn't intend to come out as a master of HTML. Rather, I generally find it be
incredibly useful just be aware of what is out there. I can't recall all the
details about using a `picture` element, but now that I know it exists, I can
always look up the relevant details later.

It's a categorical difference from not being aware of it at all.

I read the entire page for each one, took notes, and made Anki cards from the
notes.

There are a lot of deprecated elements that I only skimmed through and didn't
bother to take notes.

But even then, there were dozens of elements that I had never used before. On
top of that, there were many interesting details and attributes that I didn't
know about.

## What I Learned

The [address](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address)
element is for contact information, not just physical, mailing addresses.

## Conclusion

It was easy to feel confident about HTML after doing web development for a few
years, but there was tremendous value in going back to learn it in a somewhat
more rigorous manner.

I still think learning by doing can be a great method, but this experience has
made me want to go back and learn other things with a bottom up approach.
