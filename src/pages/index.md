# Hello, World

Welcome to my corner of the Internet. Feel free to check out my [writing](/blog)
and [other activities](/projects). I'm currently working on
[SeedFi](https://www.seedfi.com/) (as a part of [Credit
Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com)) and [Sublime
Fund](https://sublimefund.org).

If you'd like to go somewhere else but aren't sure where, try checking out a
[trending Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/hot), a [random Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random), or a [trending YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending).
