title: Prefer Numbered Lists to Bullets
---

When communicating in writing (especially asynchronously), I suggest preferring
numbered lists to bullets because numbered lists give others an easy way to
reference your specific points.

To make my communication more efficient, I first batch up what I need to say or
ask. Then I break it down into separate, addressable points. For example, if I'm
getting started on a project, I might read the requirements and come up with a
list of questions for the project manager.

Me:

> 1. What if \<insert edge case\> happens?
> 2. How urgent is this project?
> 3. Do we need legal department approval?

Project manager:

> 1. I hadn't thought about that. If it happens, how about we \<insert manual
>    workaround\>?
> 2. The CEO wants this ASAP.
> 3. They already did.

Me:

> 1. Yeah, that works. We can automate it later.
> 2. Okay, should we stop working on project A or project B so that we have
>    bandwidth to pick this up?

Project manager:

> 2. Let's stop B.

Because of the numbering, it's easier to maintain multiple conversations.
Numbers create lightweight threads that are easy to follow, even if there are
many more points than in this contrived example, and even if the back and forth
involves more than just short sentences.

When people use bullets instead, I've seen others respond by copying the entire
message and then replying inline with a different color or bolding the
responses. This seems to be a common pattern in email (as opposed to something
like Slack). I don't think that's a bad approach, but numbering things is easier
and can be enough for many conversations.

One objection could be that there is a semantic difference between numbered
lists and bulleted lists. Numbered lists imply that the order is important,
which might not be the case. My response is that:

1. This is about effective communication between humans, who are generally smart
   enough to understand when order is important.
2. The writer can always be specific that order is or is not important if the
   distinction matters.
3. If I used bullets here, and you wanted to argue that my second point is
   unconvincing, you would effectively be converting a bulleted list into a
   numbered one for convenience, which is exactly what I am saying we should be
   doing.
