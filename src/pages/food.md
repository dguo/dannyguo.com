# Food

I first started to really think about the food I eat and how it is produced
after I read [The Omnivore's
Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omnivore%27s_Dilemma) by [Michael
Pollan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan). Now I try to eat according
to the simple principles that he outlined in [Food Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Rules:_An_Eater%27s_Manual):

> Eat food, mostly plants, not too much.

In this context, food refers roughly to things that your great grandmother
would recognize as food, as opposed to all the artificial sounding ingredients
that are ubiquitous now.

This
[article](http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/03/ultimate-conversation-on-healthy-eating-and-nutrition.html)
is a nice summary to healthy eating that seems to largely agree with what I
have read elsewhere.

For [ethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_(book)), [environmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production), and [health](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/meatless-meals/art-20048193) reasons, I try to reduce the amount of meat and animal-based products that I eat.

For eggs, I check this [rating
site](https://www.cornucopia.org/scorecard/eggs/) to choose which brands to
buy.
