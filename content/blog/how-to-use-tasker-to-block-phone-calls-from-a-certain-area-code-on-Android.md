title: How to Use Tasker to Block Phone Calls From a Certain Area Code on Android
---

I've been getting a lot of spam calls. In the last year, I've noticed that the
majority are coming from numbers with the same area code as my phone number.

I don't live in the same area code anymore, so the only calls that I care about
from that area code are from people I know and whose phone numbers are in my
contacts.

I use an Android app called [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/) to automate
certain things on my phone.

I saw that Tasker
[added](https://joaoapps.com/tasker-5-11-call-screening-easy-imports-pick-inputs-and-more/)
a [call screening
feature](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/userguide/en/help/eh_call_screened.html) in
version 5.11.
