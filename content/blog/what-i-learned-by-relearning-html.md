title: What I Learned by Relearning Html
---

I made my first website in middle school as part of a class project. We learned
some basic HTML. My favorite part was embedding a MP3 song.

I didn't touch web development again until college. I made a lightweight news
aggregator called The Daily Lore. The original version is
[here](https://www.dailylore.com/legacy).

I've made other websites professionally and on the side. But I realized that all
my learning was done on the spot, in the process of making sites.

I wondered what I was missing by never actually learning HTML in a comprehensive
way. Forget CSS and JavaScript. I'm just talking about raw HTML.

## Introduction to HTML5

I went through Coursera's [Introduction to
HTML5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html) course. I expected to know a lot of
the content already, since the course was designed for complete beginners, and I
had already done web development for a few years at that point.

But it was surprising how much was new to me. I knew enough to make a seemingly
functional website, but the course reminded me about the importance of using
semantic elements and about techniques to improve accessibility, things I had
never paid much attention to.

Instead of semantic elements, I usually used a lot of generic divs to make what
I needed. The course taught me that in a lot of cases, there are specific
elements to use to represent specific content.

Accessibility was also something I had never considered. I knew that images
should have alt descriptions, and that was about it.

## Reading the Documentation

I wondered how much else I wasn't even aware of. So I decided to read the MDN
documentation for every HTML element. I have a friend who is probably the only
person I know who has read the entire NFL rulebook. Watching football with him
was fun because he was so much better than me at understanding weird cases and
how the referees would act. I figured there was a similar opportunity for me
with HTML.

I didn't intend to come out as a master of HTML. Rather, I generally find it be
incredibly useful just be aware of what is out there. I can't recall all the
details about using a `picture` element, but now that I know it exists, I can
always look up the relevant details later.

It's a categorical difference from not being aware of it at all.

I read the entire page for each one, took notes, and made Anki cards from the
notes.

There are a lot of deprecated elements that I only skimmed through and didn't
bother to take notes.

But even then, there were dozens of elements that I had never used before. On
top of that, there were many interesting details and attributes that I didn't
know about.

## What I Learned

## Conclusion

It was easy to feel confident about HTML after doing web development for a few
years, but there was tremendous value in going back to learn it in a somewhat
more rigorous manner.

I still think learning by doing can be a great method, but this experience has
made me want to go back and learn other things with a bottom up approach.
