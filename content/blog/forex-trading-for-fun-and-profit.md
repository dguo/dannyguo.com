title: Forex Trading for Fun and Profit
---

In college, I wrote foreign exchange trading programs. This was sophomore year.
My only programming experience was our introduction to programming class.  I
used a [Martingale
strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)).

# Picking a Broker

I used [Oanda](https://www.oanda.com) to trade. They let me leverage up to 50:1.

## Automation

I automated my trading with [MetaTrader
4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaTrader_4).

I bought a book named [Expert Advisor Programming: Creating Automated Trading
Systems in MQL for MetaTrader
4](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Advisor-Programming-Automated-MetaTrader/dp/0982645902?crid=3QDACH7CXL46R&keywords=Expert+Advisor+Programming%3A+Creating+Automated+Trading+Systems+in+MQL+for+MetaTrader+4&qid=1644888838&sprefix=expert+advisor+programming+creating+automated+trading+systems+in+mql+for+metatrader+4%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=2c0c6edb764af5bde0421e042ee819e1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)
and learned how to write "expert advisors" (EAs).

I didn't know how to persist data, so I used CSV files as a storage mechanism.

## Results

I remember watching the USD/JPY price change dramatically. It later turned out
to be because of the [T≈çhoku earthquake and
tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami).

I saw huge swings. To some extent, I became desensitized to it.

I don't have great records for my performance, but it looks like I deposited
$31,050. And I ended up withdrawing $38,701.99.

I was lucky that I ended up making a profit. I certainly could have lost it all
on any given day.
