title: Thinking in Binaries, Spectrums, and Dimensions
---

There are three levels of thinking: binaries, spectrums, and dimensions. In
general, we should prefer spectrums over binaries and dimensions over spectrums.

The litmus test I like to use is: how important is what I am thinking about? And
what thinking gets me closest to understanding how something actually is?

I imagine most of this will seem almost trivial to many people. But I personally
found it helpful to put it in words. Having names for things makes it easier for
me to recognize them in the real world.

You might think "of course thinking in binaries is something to avoid." But I
don't actually know when I started believing that. It is in itself not a
lightbulb moment kind of thing. You grow up, and you learn how complicated the
world is.

I try to empathize with people who do tend to see things in binaries. It's
certainly less effort.

## Thinking in Binaries

Thinking in binaries means seeing the world in black and white. It means judging
people as simply "good" or "bad." These labels are simplistic and to the point.
Sometimes it's not worth thinking any more deeply than that, or we don't have
the time to do so. But we should at least try to recognize when we are taking
the shortcut. When we are rushing to a conclusion that may be unfair.

## Thinking in Spectrums

Thinking in spectrums means allowing for gray areas. It means recognizing that
many qualities are matters of degrees rather than yes or no.

## Thinking in Dimensions

But even spectrum thinking isn't enough. A close idea is that judgments are
frequently conditional. A bad idea might only be bad under certain conditions.
As I've gotten older, I find myself saying "it depends" more frequently.

Thinking in dimensions means recognizing that there can be multiple factors to
any given situation and that the interplay between these factors can be
difficult to untangle. It means starting an answer to a question with "it
depends." I love hearing that whenever someone starts to respond to my question.

Sometimes we don't have the information to actually think in dimensions. But in
general, that should be our goal.

One of the most important lessons I have learned is that it is better to think
in spectrums rather than binaries. This isn't always a bad thing, but a part of
growing up is learning that people and the world in general are far more complex
than they might seem at first. Thinking in spectrums makes mental room for
nuance and the limitless shades of gray.

## The Three Levels

So we have three levels of thinking.

1. He is a good person.
2. He is a good person who does good things a and b, which outweigh bad things c
   and d.
3. He is a good person who does a, b, c, and d, each of which are dependent on
   factors x, y, and z.

## Movie Reviews

I loved reading Roger Ebert's movie reviews. I loved doing it right after
watching a movie.

If someone asks me if a movie is good, yes, I can give a quick thumbs up or down
for whether I think it's worth watching. But consider how much background
information that depends on. My judgment on the movie is influenced by who I am
as a person.

## Rating Systems

Many rating systems have distilled user preferences down to a positive and a
negative judgment.

* Reddit's upvote and downvote
* Facebook's like and dislike
* YouTube's like and dislike
* Netflix's thumbs up and thumbs down
* Rotten Tomatoes' systemm that is based on judging reviews as positive or
  negative

## People

Keeping this principle in mind is more important when the topic is more
emotionally charged. It's easy to label someone a racist for saying a single
thing, but racism is not a yes/no issue.

I remember having lunch with a friend in college, and he told me that he didn't
like it when people reduce others to single attributes, turning them into
caricatures of themselves. That thought has stuck with me.

## Ideas

I try to always consider the other side of any argument, no matter what it is. I
don't have any belief that is sacred enough for me to make it a black and white
issue.

When other people make claims that I don't agree with, I try to be more
interested in *why* they made that claim rather than in the claim itself.

And I try to avoid the [fundamental attribution
error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error).

This is related to the idea of requiring precision: show, don't tell. "He is a
good person" is vague and unconvincing. "He volunteers on the weekends" is much
more interesting. Specificity cuts through bullshit.

## Caveats

Thinking in binaries is most justified when there is an immediate time pressure.
You don't always have the luxury of time to deliberate. But these situations
don't happen enough to justify how often we oversimplify the world.

This is like Daniel Kahneman's distinction between system 1 and system 2
thinking in [Thinking, Fast and
Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).

## Conclusion

For me, striving to think at higher levels is ultimately about wanting to
understand the world better. It's a curiosity thing.

Binary and even spectrum thinking simplifies the world too much.
