title: Prefer Numbered Lists to Bullets
---

In the spirit of small communication tips that can add up to help someone become
a much better communicator, like [no hello](https://nohello.net), my suggestion
is to prefer numbered lists to bullets. Because numbered lists give others an
easy way to reference your specific points.

I try to make my communication more efficient. One way I do that is to batch up
what I need to say. For example, if I'm getting started on a project, I might
read the requirements and come up with a list of questions for the project
manager.

Me:

> 1. What if \<insert edge case\> happens?
> 2. How urgent is this project?
> 3. Do we need legal department approval?

Project manager:

> 1. I hadn't thought about that. If it happens, how about we \<insert manual
>    workaround\>?
> 2. The CEO wants this ASAP.
> 3. They already did.

Me:

> 1. Yeah, that works. We can automate it later.
> 2. Okay, should we stop working on project A or project B so that we have
>    bandwidth to pick this up?

Project manager:

> 2. Let's stop B.

This is a contrived example, but the point is that because we're using numbers,
it's easy to maintain multiple conversations. Numbers create lightweight threads
that are easy to follow, even if there are many points, and the back and forth
involves more than just short sentences.

When people use bullets instead, I've seen others respond by copying the entire
message and then replying inline with a different color. This seems to be a
common pattern in email (as opposed to something like Slack). I don't think
that's necessarily bad, but numbering things is easier and can be enough for
many conversations.

One objection could be that there is semantic meaning between numbered lists and
bulleted lists. Numbered lists imply that the order is important, which might
not be the case. My response is that:

1. This is about effective communication between humans, who are generally smart
   enough to understand when order is important.
2. The writer can always be specific that order is or is not important if the
   distinction matters.
3. If I used bullets here, and you wanted to argue that my second point is
   unconvincing, you would effectively be converting a bulleted list into a
   numbered one for convenience, which is exactly what I am saying we should be
   doing.
