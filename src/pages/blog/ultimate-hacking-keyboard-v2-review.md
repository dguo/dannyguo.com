title: Ultimate Hacking Keyboard V2 Review
---

## Background

I wish that split keyboards were commmoditized in the same way that mechanical
switches have been.

I considered Ergodox keyboards, such as the EZ and the Moonlander.

## Delivery

I ordered my UHK in November 2020. I received it October 2021.

## Packaging

## Hardware

I do wish I could tent the halves even higher up.

## Software

## Conclusion
