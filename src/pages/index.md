# Hello, World

Welcome to my corner of the Internet. Feel free to check out my [writing](/blog)
and [other activities](/projects). I'm currently working on
[SeedFi](https://www.seedfi.com/) (we're
[hiring](https://jobs.lever.co/SeedFi)!) and [Sublime
Fund](https://sublimefund.org).

If you'd like to go somewhere else but aren't sure where, try checking out a
[trending subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/leaderboard), a [random
Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random), or a [trending
YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending).
