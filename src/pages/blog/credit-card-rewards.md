title: Credit Card Rewards
---

One of the more disappointing aspects of the American education system is the
almost complete lack of personal finance education. I graduated college with a
minor in finance, but I still had to learn about things like the types of
retirement accounts on my own initiative. Most people don't need to use
calculus or chemistry on a day to day basis, but every one has to deal with
money.

I've frequently given friends my spiel on why almost everyone should use credit
cards. This post is intended to be a compendium on everything I know about
credit card rewards.

Most people should pay as much as possible with credit cards rather than
with debit cards, checks, or cash.

Millennials are [not

as many credit cards.

## How credit cards work

When you make a purchase with a debit card, the purchase is financed directly by
your checking account. When you use a credit card, the bank who backs your card
pays for it. You are then obligated to pay the bank back later. The bank is
essentially loaning you money. So how does the bank make money? The first way is
through fees that the bank charges merchants. This fee typically includes a fixed
amount, along with a percentage of the transaction cost. This fee is why some
places don't accept credit cards, and the fixed part of the fee is why some
places have a minimum amount for paying by credit card.

## Rewards

### Retire early

## Benefits

Many credit cards also come with ancillary benefits.

* Price protection
* Car rental insurance
* Travel insurance

## Credit score

I've found that most people don't know what actually goes into a credit score.

The first question I get most of the time is "doesn't that hurt your credit
score?" The truth is that getting a new credit card only causes a slight,
temporary tip.

## Churning

There is a [churning subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning).

### Crackdowns

In recent years, banks have adopted policies that make churning much harder.

American Express only allows one sign up bonus per card per lifetime. So once
you get the bonus for a particular card once ever.

Chase has a 5/24 rule.

## Redeeming

## Social consequences

As a side note, I think it is worth knowing how these rewards are financed.
Ultimately, they are another instance of the unfortunate truth that it is
expensive to be poor.
