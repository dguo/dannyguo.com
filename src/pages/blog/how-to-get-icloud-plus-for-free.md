title: How to Get iCloud+ for Free
---

For the past couple of years, I've subscribed to Apple's cheapest [iCloud+
plan](https://www.apple.com/icloud/#compare-plans) (with 50 GB of storage) for
free. It started unintentionally. I got the [Apple
Card](https://www.apple.com/apple-card/) and changed my iCloud+ billing to it,
but I didn't use the card for any other purchases. A few months later, I noticed
that I hadn't seen any Apple Card payments from my bank account, so I checked my
Apple Card statement. I realized that Apple Card forgives small balances, and
the cheapest iCloud+ plan is only $0.99 per month.

My latest statement shows the "Credit adjustment" at the end of the month that
brought my balance to $0. I even got $0.03 in cash back, so technically, Apple
is paying *me* $0.36 per year to have iCloud+.

I make a hobby out of [taking advantage of credit card
rewards](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/my-credit-and-debit-card-collection), so
the concept of small balance forgiveness wasn't new to me. I've seen it before
with Capital One and Discover cards, and [Doctor of Credit has a
list](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/small-balance-waiver-a-k-a-lots-of-free-99-cent-amazon-gcs/)
of data points. I never intentionally made a small purchase with the goal of
having it forgiven, since that's not worth the time. But I need iCloud+ anyway,
and since it's a subscription, I'm not spending any time on it.

A caveat is that the adjustment only happens in months where I don't use my
Apple Card for anything else. But that is typical for me because I optimize for
rewards, and Apple Card doesn't give great rewards for me. It gives 3% back at
Apple and at certain merchants with Apple Pay. It also gives 2% back with Apple
Pay in general. Instead:

1. I would put Apple purchases on my [Citi
   Rewards+](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/citi-rewards-plus-credit-card)
   card for an extra two years of extended warranty for free.
2. My [U.S. Bank Altitude
   Reserve](https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/altitude-reserve-visa-infinite-credit-card.html)
   card gives me effectively 4.5% back on all mobile wallet purchases (3x points
   with a 50% bonus when redeemed through [Real-Time
   Rewards](https://www.usbank.com/customer-service/knowledge-base/KB0192126.html)).
3. There are multiple cards that give 2% back on all purchases, with no Apple
   Pay requirement. Such as the [PayPal Cashback
   Mastercard](https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/manage-money/paypal-cashback-mastercard),
   the [SoFi Credit Card](https://www.sofi.com/credit-card/), and the [Citi
   Double Cash](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/citi-double-cash-credit-card).
