title: My Salary History
---

For a while, I've toyed with the idea of making my salary history public.

I saw [Jamie Tanna's salary history page](https://www.jvt.me/salary/).

If you'd like to maximize your salary, I recommend reading [Patrick McKenzie's
post on salary
negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/).

Salary transparency is a complicated topic. I'm not sure that it's necessarily a
good thing for any given company. It probably depends on the company. Some
podcasts on this topic are [this Planet Money
one](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/450278942) and [this Wall Street Journal
one](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/as-we-work/show-me-the-money-why-pay-transparency-is-still-controversial/d4bc1012-6c7d-40e9-ba15-fb65d0ed2ed7).

But I don't have a problem making my own salary history public. For one thing, I
try not to let my net worth play a significant factor in my sense of self-worth.
I don't want to be [this guy](https://youtu.be/A25EUhZGBws?t=329).

Personal finance is also one of my favorite topics to talk about, but people can
treat it as such a forbidden topic.

It's [generally
illegal](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages)
for companies to prohibit employees from talking about their salaries.

You can find salary data on
[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm), as well as
[Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) for tech companies in particular.
