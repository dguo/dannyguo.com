title: Why I Blog
---

Some people have asked me why I blog. Here are my reasons, in roughly decreasing
order of importance to me.

## Clarify My Thinking

Writing is the best tool I have to clarify my own thinking. I'm a natural
ruminator. I am not good at thinking on the spot. I prefer to have some time to
think through details and possible consequences.

Writing is a way for me to avoid going around in circles on something. When
thoughts are in my head, it's easy for me to miss things that become obvious
when I write them down.

If you had asked me when I was a student about the purpose of writing is, I
would have said something like putting what you think into words. What I
understand now is that that very action can change my thinking as I go.

It can give me better words to express myself.

## Sharing Knowledge

I know how good it feels to read a great blog post. Whether the post perfectly
solves a problem that I have, teaches me something new, or encourages me to
change my mind about something, I love soaking up knowledge, and I tend to
prefer blog posts over other mediums.

Every medium has its advantages and disadvantages, but blogs are usually my
favorite. They allow room for more nuance and detail than tweets, they aren't a
huge time commitment like books, they allow me to read at my own pace, unlike
videos, and they are easy to link to and reference.

Blogging allows me to share what I know. I don't claim to know particularly more
than anyone else, but I know from comments that at least a few people have find
some of my posts helpful, and that is gratifying for me.

Learning by making mistakes is painful and inefficient in general. I love to
absorb knowledge from other people so that I avoid making the same mistakes.
Likewise, I don't want others to make the same mistakes that I do, which is why
I have no problem telling everyone that I once [ppublished an AWS secret key to
a public GitHub
repo](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/i-published-my-aws-secret-key-to-github/).

## Learn Things

I usually blog about things that I am already familiar with, but sometimes I
like to use blogging as a way to learn something new. For example, I wrote a
[post on
AssemblyScript](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/the-introductory-guide-to-assemblyscript/),
which forced me to learn about it without something more involved, like a side
project.

Even for things I know well, I tend to learn new details as I write the post.
Sometimes, it's knowledge that could be useful in the future, such as the
[optional
parameters](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/how-to-check-if-a-javascript-string-begins-or-ends-with-a-string/#advanced-usage)
for `startsWith` and `endsWith` in JavaScript. I didn't know those existed until
I wrote my post.

Other times, I learn things that are interesting to me but maybe don't have much
practical value, like what the jQuery homepage [originally looked
like](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/the-history-and-legacy-of-jquery/#a-brief-history-of-jquery).

Either way, almost every blog post I write teaches me something new, even if it
doesn't end up making it into the final post.

## Practice Writing

Blogging allows me to practice writing. Most importantly, it's a form of writing
that is totally up to me. I also write during my day-to-day job (Slack messages,
emails, ticket specifications, internal documentation, etc.), but those cases
are usually driven by some external factor.

My personal blog lets me write about truly whatever I feel like writing about.
It also means that I can get feedback from a much larger audience.

## Learn How I'm Wrong

I've learned that publishing things to the internet is a fantastic way to
quickly learn what I am mistaken about or haven't considered.

## Being Able to Provide a Link

When a topic or question comes up that I have written about, I love being able
to just provide a link to my post instead of trying to recreate my past thoughts
in a way that will inevitably be less coherent than my post. For example, a
co-worker mentioned running low on hard drive space, and I just linked to my
post on [clearing Mac storage
space](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/clearing-mac-storage-space/).

This has happened more often than I would have expected, considering I don't
have that many posts.

If someone asks me why I blog again, I have this post to link to!

## Vanity

It feels good when one of my posts gets many hits. The vanity factor is real,
though I try not to let it affect my writing. I try to write about what I am
interested in writing about, rather than trying to work backwards and write
posts that I think will be popular.

## Unexpected Opportunities

My writing provided an unexpected opportunity. Someone from
[LogRocket](https://logrocket.com) read one of my posts and invited me to write
paid posts for [their technical blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/). I've written
[some posts](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/dannyguo) for them.  I basically
use these as chances to get paid to learn new things.

## Monetization

If traffic builds up to a high enough level, I could add some lightweight,
developer-focused ads using [Carbon](https://www.carbonads.net) to some of my
posts. Though Dan Luu has a good [post on this
topic](https://danluu.com/blog-ads/), and I agree that it may not be worth the
influence it could have on my writing behavior. I'm also not sure if I want to
clutter my own blog with ads. On the other hand they are only single images and
should be relatively relevant to the visitor. I've never minded Carbon ads on
other sites.

I do already add Amazon affiliate links when I would have linked to a product
anyway. I linked to The Design of Everyday Things in [this
post](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/my-seatbelt-rule-for-judgment/), and I would
have done so anyway. I made about $200 from that link. That was a nice,
unexpected benefit. And according to Amazon, people bought 30 copies of the book
through my link. That felt good, considering that I think it's a fantastic book.

## Conclusion

More than anything else, I hope this post encourages someone else to blog or
share what they know in whatever medium they prefer. When someone tells me about
something interesting, I tend to say "you should blog about this!" Nobody has
ever taken me up on it, and the world misses out on it.

Blogging has been a low friction way to share with the world for so long.

WordPress and Blogger are still perfectly good options! There's also Medium,
Dev, Svbtle, [Bear](https://bearblog.dev/), [Mataroa](https://mataroa.blog/),
and Hashnode.

Also, there's a bit of a trend that I've noticed where developers will set up a
blog and treat it like a side project in itself. They'll figure out what
framework to use and how to host it. Then you'll see an initial blog post
talking about they'd like to get into blogging and/or the technical details of
setting up the blog.

These are natural first post topics since the person is clearly thinking about
blogging or has just set up the blog, and there's nothing wrong with them. But
I'll sometimes see a blog where that's the only post. And I'd speculate that it
wasn't gratifying enough for the person to keep going.

Blogging is hard! At least it is for me. It can take me a long time to research,
write, and edit a post. And even then, I've published posts that I knew could be
better with some more effort.

My advice is to start writing about whatever you are most interested in thinking
about. Blogging itself may be the most *recent* thing you have thought about,
but is it really your biggest interest?

This post is basically my version "here's why I'm interested in blogging," but
consider how different it would be if it was my very first post. I would still
probably make some remarks about *hoping* that it would clarify my thinking,
allow me to share knowledge, and let me practice writing. But now I can make the
same points with details from personal experience.

The 2017 version of this post would not have been far shorter, not as fun to
read, and not as fun to write.

I do understand the fun of treating a personal blog as another side project. I
don't use a blogging platform. I build my site with Hugo, push it up to GitHub,
and serve it with Netlify. Setting all that up was pretty fun! But when it comes
to writing, just like any other content medium, it's the content that matters
most.

Focus on the content and then you can always improve the details later on.  The
content itself is far more important than how you're hosting it.

One of my favorite blog posts is Rob Pike's [post on his biggest surprise when
rolling out
Go](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html).
Sure, it's hosted on Blogger and served with a font size that is a little small
for. But the content is so interesting. I love this little slice into Pike's
experience. It doesn't really matter that the font size causes an unoptimal
measure, so I just used Firefox's reader mode to reread it.

Focus on the content. There's where the value is. I'd rather watch Breaking Bad
on a tiny, 480p screen than to watch an average show in 4K.
