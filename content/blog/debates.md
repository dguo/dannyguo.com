At the beginning of high school, I attended an info session for the debate team.
I was excited because I had a notion of what debates would be like: a group of
people having a discussion and arriving at conclusions based on evidence and
reasoning. It hadn't occurred to me that in the context of debate teams, a
debate is a competition. And in any competition, the ultimate point is to win.

A feeling of disappointment washed over me as the info session went over the
structure of a [Lincoln-Douglas
debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%E2%80%93Douglas_debates). I
realized that you win a debate by making the most convincing case for your side
of the position, and what side you would actually take in real life is
irrelevant. This seemed hopelessly disingenuous to me.

I get the same feeling every time I watch a political debate. No politician is
going to change his or her mind in the middle of a debate or acknowledge that
the opponent has made a good point.

We have fact checkers after the fact or sometimes even during the debates, but
that in itself is disheartening because it means the debates proceed with
statements that can't even be relied on.

Some people consider it a skill when debaters dodge the question by either
ignoring it and answering the question that they really wanted to be asked.

I'm not saying that debaters don't pick up valuable skills along the way. I've
watched videos of championship debates, and the level of discourse is far
higher than what I typically experience in everyday life.

One of my favorite episodes in The West Wing is The Supremes.

In particular, the interaction between Chris Mulready and Charlie has always
stuck with me. Here's the transcript of [the
scene](https://youtu.be/q4m-3Eo3suE?t=40):

> So why a racial preference and not an economic one?
> Because affirmative action's about a legacy of racial oppression.
> It's about compromising admission standards.
> That's bull..excuse me. It's about leveling the playing field after 300 years
> of..
> See, this is where the liberal argument goes off the rails. You get stuck in

> admits have a higher predisposition to contribute to society.
> Hang on, I gotta write this down.
