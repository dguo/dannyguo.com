title: Automating TurboTax Data Entry With Puppeteer
---
import Video from "../../components/video.astro";

I use [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/) for some of my investments. For
my 2018 tax return, I wanted to use the [free
edition](https://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/online/free-edition.jsp) of
[Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/)'s [TurboTax
Online](https://turbotax.intuit.com/). For non-retirement account investments,
each transaction must be documented in the tax return with [Form
8949](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8949). I had hundreds of
transactions for my account in 2018, and I didn't want to enter them manually.

Betterment has a [TurboTax
integration](https://www.betterment.com/help/tax-importing-turbotax) to do
this work automatically, but TurboTax [doesn't
allow](https://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/compare/online/) importing
investment transactions unless you have the Premier plan or above. I also
couldn't [import a TXF
file](https://github.com/andreasg123/stock-gain-tax-import) because that feature
is only available in the desktop versions of TurboTax.

This seemed like a great opportunity to try out
[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). It's a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) library for controlling
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and is developed by the Chrome team.

In the end, I probably [spent more time automating the
process](https://xkcd.com/1319/) than it would have taken to just enter the
transactions manually, but I learned a new tool, and I hope to reuse the script
in the future. It's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dguo/broker-scribe)
with the name BrokerScribe. Here's a demo of the end result (running at half
speed):

## Parsing the CSV file

First, I downloaded the
[1099-B](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-b) CSV file from
Betterment's [tax forms page](https://wwws.betterment.com/app/tax_forms).

![Betterment tax forms](https://i.imgur.com/iZnRus1.png)

After removing an extraneous comma at the end of the header row, I used
[xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) to look at the available columns.

```
$ xsv headers betterment-1099-b.csv
1   Account
2   Description
3   Symbol
4   CUSIP
5   Date Acquired
6   Date Sold
7   Gross Proceeds
8   Cost or Other Basis
9   Gain/(Loss)
10  Wash Sale Loss Disallowed
11  Federal Income Tax Withheld
12  Type of Gain(Loss)
13  Noncovered Securities
14  Reporting Category
```

Then I inspected the values to get an idea of what the data looks like.

```
$ xsv table betterment-1099-b.csv | xsv sample 3
Account                  Description                                                   Symbol  CUSIP      Date Acquired  Date Sold   Gross Proceeds  Cost or Other Basis  Gain/(Loss)  Wash Sale Loss Disallowed  Federal Income Tax Withheld  Type of Gain(Loss)  Noncovered Securities  Reporting Category

```

I used [neat-csv](https://github.com/sindresorhus/neat-csv) to read in the data.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const csv = require('neat-csv');

(async () => {
    let transactions = fs.readFileSync('betterment-1099-b.csv');
    transactions = await csv(transactions);
})();
```

## Using Puppeteer

I launched Puppeteer in non-headless mode so that the browser UI would actually
appear and be controllable from outside of the script. It launches a bundled
version of Chromium (which Chrome is built on). It's possible to [control an
existing installation](https://stackoverflow.com/q/47122579/1481479) of Chrome,
but each version of the library is only guaranteed to work with its bundled
browser.

I also turned off the default viewport so that [resizing the window would also
resize the viewport](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/3688).

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
        defaultViewport: null,
        headless: false
    });
})();
```

## Logging in

The first step in the TurboTax workflow was logging in.

![TurboTax login page](https://i.imgur.com/leJ1KaV.png)

```js
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://myturbotax.intuit.com/');
```

I used [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) to interactively collect
authentication info. I considered passing the info through environment
variables, but I ran into two-factor authentication later, so I needed to be
able to collect a dynamic code.

```js
const {email, password} = await prompts([
    {
        type: 'text',
        name: 'email',
        message: 'Email address'
    },
    {
        type: 'text',
        name: 'password',
        message: 'Password',
        style: 'password',
    }
]);
```

I set the input values with JS after finding out [how to pass a
variable](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46098448/1481479) to
[evaluate](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=master&show=api-pageevaluatepagefunction-args).

```js
await page.evaluate(email => {
    document.getElementById('ius-identifier').value = email;
    document.getElementById('ius-remember').checked = false;
}, email);
```

Next, I had to figure out how to handle waiting for the UI to be "ready" after
hitting submit. In my experience, this part is a common source of flakiness for
UI tests using tools like [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) and
[Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/). I tried following the
[example](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=master&show=api-pagewaitfornavigationoptions)
in the documentation.

```js
await Promise.all([
    page.waitForNavigation(),
    page.click('#ius-sign-in-submit-btn')
]);
```

Unfortunately, I kept getting this error: `TimeoutError: Navigation Timeout
Exceeded: 30000ms exceeded`. At first, I tried playing around with different
`waitForNavigation` options, but then I realized that the site was built as a
[single-page
application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). While
Puppeteer [does
treat](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer#q-whats-considered-a-navigation)
[History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) usage as
a navigation event, the site doesn't use the History API. It merely updates the
form on the page. I tried to wait for the existence of the password field
instead using
[waitFor](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=master&show=api-pagewaitforselectororfunctionortimeout-options-args).

![TurboTax password field](https://i.imgur.com/8Tlu496.png)

```js
await Promise.all([
    page.waitFor(
        '#ius-sign-in-mfa-password-collection-current-password'
    ),
    page.click('#ius-sign-in-submit-btn')
]);
```

This solution worked. I filled in the password the same way that I filled in the
email. The next part of the form was for two-factor
authentication, using a code that was sent to my email. However, it only
triggered some of the time, even after unchecking remember me on the first part
of the log in form. This meant that I didn't have a stable element to wait for.
My original solution was to just put in a sleep and then check if the two-factor
authentication form appeared.

```js
await page.waitFor(5000); // in milliseconds

if ((await page.$('#ius-mfa-options-submit-btn')) !== null) {
    // collect the code, and submit it
}
```

However, I now realize that a much better solution would have been to use a
selector with two elements, one for each possible path, with something like:

```js
await page.waitFor('#ius-mfa-options-submit-btn, #dashboard');
```

This method avoids the antipattern of sleeping with a hardcoded duration, which
slows things down and makes the code more brittle since the duration might not
be long enough if the server is slow to respond, the client is on a poor
internet connection, etc.

## Entering transactions

After logging in, I had to enter transactions to fill this page.

![empty Betterment sales page](https://i.imgur.com/xLZPby9.png)

I matched up each field on this form to the respective column in the CSV file.

![empty transaction form](https://i.imgur.com/1BuZOY2.png)

I continued to set the values directly with in-page JS.

```js
await page.evaluate(transaction => {
    document.getElementById('edt_00').value = transaction.description;
    document.getElementById('edt_01').value = transaction.dateSold;
    document.getElementById('edt_02').value = transaction.dateAcquired;
    document.getElementById('edt_03').value = transaction.grossProceeds;
    document.getElementById('edt_04').value = transaction.costBasis;

    let category;
    if (transaction.reportingCategory === 'D') {
        category = '4';
    } else if (transaction.reportingCategory === 'A') {
        category = '1';
    } else {
        throw new Error('Unexpected reporting category');
    }

    document.getElementById('combo_00').value = category;
}, transaction);
```

But I ran into validation errors, even though I could see the values in the
fields before trying to continue. I received an error message, and the fields
were blanked out.

![form validation errors](https://i.imgur.com/WCc92oi.png)

I suspected that the form has validation that runs as the user enters data. By
setting the value directly, the validation was bypassed, and it thought the user
had left the fields blank. After reading through [this
issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/441) and [this
question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/45864516/1481479), I found a better
approach, which was to use the
[type](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.14.0&show=api-pagetypeselector-text-options)
and
[select](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.14.0&show=api-pageselectselector-values)
methods instead of setting values with JS. Using these methods fixed the issue.

```js
await page.type('#edt_00', transaction.description);
await page.select('#combo_00', category);
```

After submitting the transaction, there was a radio selection to choose if I
wanted to submit another one. I tried clicking the "enter a new transaction"
radio with Puppeteer's
[click](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=master&show=api-pageclickselector-options)
method.

```js
await page.click('#radio_00\\:0');
```

But this time, the more ergonomic approach didn't work. After hitting continue,
the page thought I didn't make a choice. I tried clicking the radio with JS, and
I was able to continue.

```js
await page.evaluate(() => {
    document.querySelector('#radio_00\\:0').click();
});
```

The final issue I ran into was that I would get `Error: Node is either not
visible or not an HTMLElement` when trying to fill in info on the new
transaction page. My guess for the root cause is that the site animates some DOM
changes, like the appearance of the form, most likely with [CSS
transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions).
Puppeteer's `waitFor` only detects the element's existence in the DOM. It
doesn't know if the element is visible, if click handlers have been attached,
etc. I added a one second sleep as a workaround. A future improvement would be to
find a way to wait for the end of any transitions.

In the end, the script took about 30 minutes to fill in all my transactions. I
checked several of them to verify that the information was transcribed
correctly.

## Conclusion

I have three main takeaways from my first experiment with Puppeteer. The first
is that I should default to using the high-level API (e.g. `type`, `select`,
`click`) first before resorting to injecting JS with `evaluate`. The high-level
API is cleaner and better simulates a real human being using the website.

The second is that I need to be smarter about waiting for things to be ready
rather than adding sleeps. I've resorted to sleeping quite often in my past
end-to-end test code, but it's something I need to minimize going forward.

The third is that handling websites that use fancier techniques like animations
or are built as SPAs can be tricky. I
[found](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/372)
[multiple](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/1805)
[issues](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/2977) with people
having problems interacting with elements, and a common explanation is that the
site's JS hasn't fully run yet.

Regardless, I see a lot of potential in using Puppeteer, especially for
automated tests. The author of [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) [stopped
development](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/phantomjs/9aI5d-LDuNE/5Z3SMZrqAQAJ)
after headless Chrome was announced. Another big tool in this field is
[Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/), but it's not very reliable in my
experience, harder to set up, and resource heavy. I'm optimistic that Puppeteer
will prove to be a better option for most cases.

One concern is that Puppeteer only works for Chrome, but the Puppeteer
developers appear to be working on [experimental
support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-firefox) for Firefox.
[Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) is also
[switching to
Chromium](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/12/post-mortem-tying-edge-to-windows-10-was-a-fatal-error/),
and most fringe browsers like [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) and
[Brave](https://brave.com/) run on Chromium. For non-testing purposes, such as
taking screenshots and automating workflows like BrokerScribe does, browser
compatibility doesn't really matter, and Puppeteer is shaping up to be a great
alternative to Selenium.
