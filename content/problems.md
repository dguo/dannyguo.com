This is a list of problems, complaints, suggestions, etc.

* Restaurant menus should have pictures for every item. Nutrition info would also be nice.
* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
    * In the web version, it's not possible to add/remove table rows.
    * Opening a note in the web version causes nested lists to be flattened. These changes seem to sync, so the lists are flattened even in the native clients.
* [Halo 5: Guardians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_5:_Guardians)
    * The ["Top Gun" medal](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Top_Gun_medal) claims to be awarded "when the player is the first person on their team to reach ten kills," but it seems to only be awarded to the first player *in the match* to reach ten kills. I've never seen it get awarded to two people in the same match.
    * Ranked matches are still played to completion when a player quits before the match even starts.
    * Assault rifle and pistol is the starting weapon combination for most playlists. But whenever you spawn, you have the assault rifle equipped. It should be the pistol instead considering how much better it is in most situations.
