title: BEBEN X8 Review

The [BEBEN X8
headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PN2FK2W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=c7e6ea9cd21015aa5bb8bae9d67481db&language=en_US)
are a set of true wireless headphones, like the [Apple
Airpods](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=airpods&qid=1597609643&s=electronics&sr=1-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=f74c368f5b3a2c83060da85acc1b2394&language=en_US),
which are probably the [market
leader](https://fortune.com/2019/08/06/apple-airpods-business/) in this
category.

Many of the big electronics companies have made their own versions. Samsung has
[Galaxy
Buds](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Earbuds-Cancelling-Warranty/dp/B089B658NP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=galaxy+buds&qid=1597609784&s=electronics&sr=1-6&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=db5cafcb0e4ebeeae94ba2966657ebbd&language=en_US),
Sony has the
[WF-1000XM3](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=sony+wf-1000xm3&qid=1597611240&s=electronics&sr=1-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=50eb905f27c0da50abc99f7c348f0e91&language=en_US)
and, Google has [Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_buds).
But when I looked into buying a pair of true wireless headphones, I realized
that it has become a commoditized technology. Amazon has plenty of more
affordable (less than $100) options from relatively unknown brands.

I planned to use my headphones mainly while exercising, and I knew exactly what
features I was looking for and which I didn't really care about, so your needs
may be very different from mine.

The two key things I wanted were:

1. Explicit waterproofing so that I can run in the rain
2. Physical buttons instead of touch or voice controls

Audio quality was not that important to me, and I cared even less about
microphone quality. I also wasn't concerned about battery life, since I don't
plan to use them much while traveling.

While many options on Amazon have waterproofing, the X8s were one of the few
with physical buttons. I also liked that the case supports wireless charging.

I did come across two interesting features that I haven't seen with the big
brands. The first is an LED display to show exactly how much charge is left. The
second is that the charging case can have a USB port to charge your phone. [This
pair](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Headphones-Waterproof-Earphones/dp/B07W87HQ6G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=true+wireless+headphones+waterproof&qid=1601255652&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=c9e04b30a4701d74fc4056204995bdbf&language=en_US)
has both features.

I bought the X8s for $46, but I've seen it go as low as $30 since then.

## Packaging

The package comes with the case, headphones, a short Micro-USB to USB cable, a
lanyard, and a differently sized tips.

## Waterproofing

I've gone running several times in the rain with my X8s, and they have always
handled the water just fine. They are [IP
rated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code) for IP68, which means that they do
not allow any dust in and are resistant to submersion in water up to 1 meter in
depth, but I haven't tested actually submerging them in water.

## Battery Life and Charging

I've used my X8s for over a year, and battery life has never been a
problem for me. The package claims that the headphones last 5 hours on a single
charge.

The case has a Micro-USB port for charging. I do wish this was a USB-C port
instead, but it's hard to complain for the price.

The case also supports wireless charging, which is how I normally charge it.

## Connecting

Pairing works just by taking the earbuds out of the case. They automatically try
to connect. There have been a few times where I wish there was a way to manually
tell the buds to pair. On the rare occassion where I've wanted to switch
devices, I needed to put the earbuds back into the case and take them back out
just to get them back into pairing mode.

I've also had to do it a few times when the earbuds didn't connect immediately.
I think this has only happened when I took the earbuds out before turning on
Bluetooth on my phone. When I use my earbuds now, I've trained myself to turn on
Bluetooth first.

Sometime the audio does cut out in one headphone for a few seconds.

## Audio Quality

## Microphone Quality

## Controls

I also wanted physical buttons, mainly for quick volume adjustments without
having to mess with a touch sensitive interface or having to speak to a digital
assistant, which would be annoying to do while running.

The physical buttons were a big reason I chose this pair, and they work as
reliably as I expected. I can press either button once to pause or play. Holding
the left one increases the volume, and holding the right one decreases it.

I make small volume adjustments fairly frequently when I'm running, and I love
not having to pull out my phone or speak to a virtual assistant to do it.

## Conclusion

I've been very happy with my X8s. They cost a fraction of the price of
most namebrand options.
