title: A Tribute to Kindle
---
I've been thinking about just how many digital devices I own. Excluding
accessories like my keyboard, the full list is:

* [Apple iPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(2017)) (2017)
* [Apple Macbook
  Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Third_generation_(Retina))
  (2015 13")
* [Amazon Echo Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo#Echo_Dot) (2nd generation)
* [Amazon Kindle
  Paperwhite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_Paperwhite_(2nd_generation))
  (2nd generation)
* [Google Home Mini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Home#Home_Mini)
* [Lenovo IdeaPad Y410p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IdeaPad_Y_Series#Y410p)
* [Microsoft Xbox 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360)
* [Microsoft Xbox One S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One#Xbox_One_S)
* [Motorola Droid Turbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_Turbo)
* [Raspberry Pi Model B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Model_B)
* [Roku Premiere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku#Fifth_generation)
* [Samsung Galaxy S7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S7)

Of all of these, I appreciate my Kindle the most. While my laptop and phone are
indispensable, they also cause a fair amount of frustration and distraction on
a daily basis. Concerns about our relationships with digital devices are
common, whether they are mental (e.g. [decreasing attention
spans](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/opinion/the-eight-second-attention-span.html)),
emotional (e.g. [increasing feelings of
loneliness](https://theconversation.com/how-the-digitalisation-of-everything-is-making-us-more-lonely-90870)),
or physical (e.g. [neck
problems](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/634318/Smartphone-tablet-gadgets-effect-health)).
My Kindle, for the most part, doesn't trigger these concerns. It simply
improves the reading experience in almost every way.

## Positives

Physical books take up space and are absurdly heavy. Every time I move, I get
rid of a few more of them. My Kindle can hold thousands of books, yet it weighs
less and is smaller than many paperback books.

My Kindle knows where I left off in each book. For physical books, bookmarks
fall out easily, and folding corners feels destructive.

I can hold my Kindle and even turn pages with one hand, which is great for
reading when I'm standing in a subway train.

The Paperwhite's backlight means I can read anywhere and anytime. This alone is
a killer feature over physical books.

Unlike smartphones and laptops, my Kindle never gives me battery anxiety. I can
go weeks without charging it.

My Kindle doesn't kill my attention span like my smartphone does. If anything,
it helps me focus on long-form content rather than seek another dopamine hit on
Twitter or Reddit.

I can check out books online from the New York Public Library's [e-book
website](https://nypl.overdrive.com/).

I can look up word definitions.

I can see all my highlights online.

The [E Ink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_Ink) screen is as easy to read as
paper, even in bright sunlight.

It's relatively cheap. The Paperwhite is frequently on sale for $99, and while
I know Amazon wants me to buy Kindle books through its store, I get almost all
my books from the library, so the content has been close to free for me.

The upgrade cycle is long. I'm still using the same Kindle I bought five
years ago and feel no need to get a new one.

## Negatives

I like the idea of having a bookshelf full of books that are meaningful to me,
but buying a book just for display doesn't seem like a good use of money.

Graphs and images don't work so well sometimes.

This is a very minor issue, but I do wish my Kindle was waterproof.  The second
generation [Kindle
Oasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_Oasis_(2nd_generation))
is waterproof though, and I hope Amazon eventually brings the feature to the
Paperwhite as well.

UI interactions feel slow. I assume later Kindles have improved the speed with
better hardware.

Highlighting is easy, but taking notes is so hard that I have to do it
externally rather than on the Kindle. For me, that's true for physical books as
well, since I don't like to write in books.

See [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)'s
[objections to e-books](https://stallman.org/articles/ebooks.pdf). I am
sympathetic, but I still choose to use my Kindle everyday.

## Conclusion

My Kindle does one thing, and it does it exceptionally well. It may not be
perfect, but I don't have a love-hate relationship with it. I wish I could say
that about all my devices.
