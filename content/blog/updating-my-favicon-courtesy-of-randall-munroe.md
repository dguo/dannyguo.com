title: Updating My Favicon, Courtesy of Randall Munroe
---

Since 2017, my personal website's
[favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) was a [yin-yang
symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang) that I added on a whim. I
didn't think about it again for a long time. Until I published a post on
[serving videos instead of
GIFs](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/serve-videos-instead-of-gifs/), and one
Reddit comment [helpfully pointed
out](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/gl7ttl/serve_videos_instead_of_gifs/fqw7lap/)
how absurdly large my favicon was:

> And yet that webpage has a 170kb favicon - a 256x256 image with essentially 3
> colors but stored in an uncompressed 24 bit format.

I appreciated the callout! I thought about changing my favicon to my initials or
something like that, but then I remembered a sketch that I got from [Randall
Munroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe), who is the author of
[*xkcd*](https://xkcd.com/) and [*What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd
Hypothetical
Questions*](https://www.amazon.com/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/0544272994?crid=FJWL4J94JJN5&keywords=randall+munroe&qid=1654983209&sprefix=randall+munroe%2Caps%2C75&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=be65676d693ee4c0c09c8f09c58096fc&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).

When I was in college, he visited to give a
[talk](https://lectures.princeton.edu/lectures/2011/larry-gonick-randall-munroe).
After the talk, I asked him to autograph a printout of
[#876](https://xkcd.com/876/), which references [Plato's
Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) from [*The
Republic*](https://www.amazon.com/Republic-Plato-Allan-Bloom/dp/0465094082?crid=316HZB89FGE9H&keywords=republic+plato&qid=1654984868&sprefix=republic+plato%2Caps%2C76&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=thdalo00-20&linkId=49c528f777b799c5c446689d491c84f4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)
(I was a philosophy major). I also asked him if he could draw
[Rodin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Rodin)'s [*The
Thinker*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker) for me, and he was kind
enough to do it. Here's a scan of it:

I cropped out the sketch and used
[RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate favicons
from it. There are multiple ones for different scenarios, and they range from
479 bytes to 15 KB. Much better than the original 170 KB.

The sketch is maybe a *bit* too detailed for a favicon, but I love it anyway.
