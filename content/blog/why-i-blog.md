title: Why I Blog
---

Some people have asked me why I blog. I figured I could turn my answer into its
own blog post.

Writing helps me clarify my own thinking.

It's a way to practice writing in general.

Writing helps me learn.

Writing lets me share what I know.

There's a vanity factor.

Writing has brought me some unexpected opportunities.
